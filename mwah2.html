    <p>Happy Birthday, My love ,My cutie,My Krishna
Today i feel so blessed because it’s your day ,the day my world was blessed with you I’ve been thinking about how to put into words what you mean to me and no matter how much I try, nothing could ever really match the way you make me feel But I’m going to try because you deserve to hear it
From the moment you came into my life everything changed. I didn’t know that someone could make me feel so safe so understood and so loved .You’ve become the reason I look forward to every tomorrow u are the person I want to share all my laughs, my tears, my dreams, and my whole soul with You are my greatest gift, my safe place.
I love you more than I thought it was even possible to love someone It’s in the way i feel so happy when I see your name on my phone the way my body feels warm when you hold me close.
You’ve seen me at my best but more importantly you’ve seen me at my worst and you stayed. That’s something I’ll never stop being grateful for You didn’t love me just when I was easy to love, you loved me through the messy days, the insecurities, the doubts. And that’s why I promise you this no matter what happens, no matter how hard life gets, I will never let go of you You’re my forever, my once in a lifetime, and I will fight for you and for us until my very last breath.
Sometimes I think about how lucky I am, and honestly, I don’t feel worthy of you. You’re everything I ever wanted and so much more than I thought I deserved You’re so kind and strong in ways you don’t even realize, and your heart is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever known and I wonder how I got so blessed to be the one who gets to call you mine i swear I’ll spend my life trying to be as good to you as you’ve been to me
You’re not just my boyfriend you’re my best friend, my husband ,my dad ,my baby and the only person I want beside me through all of life’s ups and downs You make me feel understood in ways no one else ever has like you see all the parts of me I try to hide and still love me anyway And I love all of you your laugh, your smile, the way you think, the way you care, the way you love 
This isn’t just love baby. This is forever. This is me choosing you every single day for the rest of my life Through the good, through the bad, through every change and every challenge I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. You could lose everything in the world and I’d still be holding your hand because you are my world
On your birthday, I just want you to know that I see you I see how hard you try, how much you care for me and the ppl around you, how you keep going even when life throws obstacles your way. You inspire me every single day. You make me want to be a better person, not because you’ve ever asked me to change, but because loving you makes me want to give you the absolute best version of me
I don’t ever want you to doubt my love for you It’s not something that fades with time .It’s forever. Even when we’re old and gray I’ll still look at you with the same spark in my eyes, still reach for your hand still be the one who’s there cheering you on in everything you do. My love for you isn’t just a feeling it’s a promise.
And I promise that when you’re feeling lost I’ll help you find your way. When you feel weak, I’ll be your strength And when you forget how amazing you are, I’ll remind you over and over again until you believe it 
I don’t care what life throws at us distance, time, struggles because I know that as long as I have you, I can face anything
So here’s to you my love. To the man who stole my heart and made it his forever. To the man who makes me laugh until I can’t breathe, who makes me feel like the luckiest girl alive just by existing
Happy birthday, my baby. Thank you for being you for loving me, for choosing me for staying and I’m going to spend the rest of my days making sure you know just how deeply, endlessly, unconditionally I love you.

Always and forever yours
YOUR CHINNUMARI</p>
